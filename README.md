## üîÆ AI Prompt That Could Generate This Project

If you wanted to recreate this project using a single AI prompt, here's what you might use:

---

**"Create a modern, single-file HTML podcast news aggregator with the following specifications:**

**Core Functionality:**
- Aggregate RSS feeds from BBC, CBC (5 shows), ABC Australia, Al Jazeera, NPR, and Democracy Now
- Add French feeds: News in Slow French and France Inter
- Parse RSS/XML using DOMParser with multiple CORS proxy fallbacks
- Display latest episodes with date sorting (newest first)
- Progressive loading - show cards as feeds load individually

**Audio Features:**
- Global speed control (0.5x-2x) and sleep timer (15min-1hr) at top of page
- Sleep timer with 2-minute gradual volume fade before auto-pause
- Auto-pause other episodes when starting new one
- Apply global settings to newly played audio

**Interface Requirements:**
- Dark/light theme toggle with localStorage persistence
- English/French/Both language switching
- Responsive CSS Grid layout with 280px minimum card width
- Each card shows: source, episode image, title (14pt), time + duration, Play button
- Expandable episode summaries (hide for NPR/ABC/Al Jazeera - no useful summaries)
- 80x80px podcast images with fallback handling

**Technical Details:**
- Handle duration formats: seconds (BBC), MM:SS (Democracy Now), HH:MM:SS (CBC)
- Extract images from itunes:image, media:thumbnail, or channel image
- Use browser-like headers for better RSS access
- Filter out non-podcast feeds (must have audio enclosures)
- Handle CBC contentLink audio elements
- Progressive loading with fade-in animations
- CORS proxies: corsproxy.io, api.codetabs.com, cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com

**Styling:**
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Dark theme: #0b0c0d background, #15171a cards, #79b8ff accent
- Light theme: white background, #f8f9fa cards, #0366d6 accent
- Loading spinner with minimal animation
- Clean typography with system fonts
- Proper hover states and accessibility

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation when feeds fail
- Multiple CORS proxy attempts
- Console logging for debugging
- Error messages for users when all feeds fail

Use modern JavaScript (async/await, fetch, CSS custom properties) in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript."**

This prompt would generate approximately 90% of the current functionality, though refinements would likely be needed for the specific feed handling and advanced features.
