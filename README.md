## AI Prompt

I need a single HTML file that creates a fully accessible podcast aggregator. It should:

1. **Fetch and Parse RSS**: Aggregate 15+ podcast RSS feeds (English and French news/politics)
2. **Display Cards**: Show episodes in reverse chronological order with podcast source, image, title, time/duration
3. **Audio Controls**: 30-second skip forward/backward buttons, keyboard shortcuts (‚Üê/‚Üí/Space), HTML5 player integration
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliant with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, 4.5:1 contrast ratios
5. **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid layout, dark/light themes with accessible colors, expandable summaries
6. **Language Filter**: Switch between English, French, or Both languages with cache management
7. **Duplicate Prevention**: Track seen episodes using GUID ‚Üí audioUrl ‚Üí link ‚Üí title hierarchy
8. **Data Processing**: Parse pubDate, handle various RSS formats, manage images and fallbacks
9. **Performance**: Progressive loading with fade animations, cache versioning, manual cache clearing

Key feeds to include: CBC, BBC, NPR, PBS, Al Jazeera, France Info, RFI, Radio Canada, InnerFrench, etc.

Technical requirements: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, localStorage for themes and cache, CORS proxy fallbacks, comprehensive error handling, semantic HTML landmarks, ARIA live regions for dynamic content.

Use modern JavaScript (async/await, fetch, CSS custom properties) in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

This prompt would generate approximately 90% of the current functionality, though refinements would likely be needed for the specific feed handling and advanced features.
